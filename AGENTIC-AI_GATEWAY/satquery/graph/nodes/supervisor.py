"""Supervisor node: pick the specialist for this turn.

Routing is driven by the user's **query intent** and the **number of images**
supplied — never by which upload field (`optical` / `sar` / `image_t1` /
`image_t2`) was used. Those labels are optional hints that only tell a
specialist which image is which; a client can just send `images[]` and let the
supervisor work out what to run.

Decision order:
1. A retry that targeted a specific specialist wins.
2. Unambiguous query intent + enough images (e.g. "what changed" + >= 2 images).
3. Structural hints from labelled uploads (t1+t2, or optical+sar).
4. LLM classification, then bounded to what the image count allows.
