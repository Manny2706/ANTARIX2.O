2. what evidence is missing
3. which ONE specialist should provide the missing evidence

AVAILABLE SPECIALISTS:

IMAGE_ANALYSIS - single optical or SAR image analysis, captioning, scene
description, single-image VQA

CHANGE_DETECTION - comparison of an EARLIER image and a LATER image,
bi-temporal change analysis

CROSS_MODAL - comparison of an OPTICAL image and a SAR image; required when the
question asks to compare optical and SAR, or when one modality is missing from
the current evidence

GEO_SPATIAL - CRS, geographic coordinates, spatial bounds, resolution, physical
area, distance

RETRIEVAL - domain knowledge, background information

DECISION RULES:
- If the user asks to compare OPTICAL and SAR and the current evidence contains
  only optical information, choose CROSS_MODAL.
- If the user asks what changed between T1 and T2, choose CHANGE_DETECTION.
- If the user asks about coordinates, CRS, area, distance, or geographic
  properties, choose GEO_SPATIAL.
- If the user asks for single-image description or VQA, choose IMAGE_ANALYSIS.
- If the current evidence is sufficient, choose NONE.

IMPORTANT:
- Select exactly ONE required action.
- Do not choose IMAGE_ANALYSIS merely because an optical description is missing.
- Consider the USER QUESTION first, then what evidence is actually missing.
- Do not invent evidence and do not perform the analysis yourself.
